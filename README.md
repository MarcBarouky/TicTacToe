## Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game project! This project features a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python, equipped with three levels of difficulty. The game utilizes advanced algorithms to provide a challenging experience for players of all skill levels.

### Features
#### Three Levels of Difficulty:
  Easy: The AI makes random moves, offering a casual experience.
  Medium: The AI uses a basic strategy to block and win, presenting a moderate challenge.
  Unbeatable: The AI employs the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and depth-limited search methods to ensure the optimal move at every turn, making it impossible to defeat.
  
### Algorithms
#### Minimax Algorithm:
A decision-making algorithm used for finding the optimal move by simulating all possible moves and their outcomes.

#### Alpha-Beta Pruning:
An optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm that eliminates branches in the search tree, significantly reducing computation time while maintaining the optimality of the moves.

#### Depth-Limited Search:
A method to limit the depth of the search tree, balancing between performance and decision quality, especially in more complex scenarios.

### How to Play
Run the Game: Execute the Python script to start the game.
Choose Difficulty: Select your desired level of difficulty (Easy, Medium, Unbeatable).
Make Your Move: Follow the on-screen prompts to make your move on the board.
Challenge the AI: Compete against the AI and try to win!
